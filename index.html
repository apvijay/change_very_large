      <p>
We address the challenging problem
of registration and change detection in very large motion
blurred images. The unreasonable demand that this task
puts on computational and memory resources precludes the
possibility of any direct attempt at solving this problem. We
address this issue by observing the fact that the camera motion
experienced by a sufficiently large sub-image is approximately
the same as that of the entire image itself. We devise an
algorithm for judicious sub-image selection so that the camera
motion can be deciphered correctly, irrespective of the presence
or absence of occluder. We follow a reblur-difference frame-
work to detect changes as this is an artifact-free pipeline unlike
the traditional deblur-difference approach. We demonstrate the
results of our algorithm on both synthetic and real data.
